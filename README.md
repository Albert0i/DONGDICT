### Dong Dict 


### Prologue
In the year of 2011, I began with the chinese historical novel **Dong Zhou Lie Guo Zhi** (東周列國志) which is a voluminous piece of writing. On 2013/05/13, I finished with the first read and on 2017/10/13 the second read. During the years, characters, events, locations and terms were jotted down in text format, ie. hundreds and thousands of entries in a file of 23.0 MB (24,199,940 bytes). 


### I. The manuscript 
Each entry started with a **pipe** character "|" which immediately followed description on the next line, ie: 

|word
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Quos animi obcaecati, placeat perspiciatis illo, incidunt autem recusandae repudiandae cum doloremque, pariatur iusto? Dolorum fugit quas nobis maxime, magnam beatae ex?

The following defines a **synonym group**:

|wordA
|wordB
|wordC
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Quos animi obcaecati, placeat perspiciatis illo, incidunt autem recusandae repudiandae cum doloremque, pariatur iusto? Dolorum fugit quas nobis maxime, magnam beatae ex?

wordA, wordB and wordC shares the same description. There was no way to prevent from inputting duplicated entry. 


### II. An early attempt
In the year of 2012, I was thinking to make a web site to enable dictionary look up. My idea was to statically generate an index.html and one html page for each entry, so that I could host the static web site easily. A regular re-generation is necessary to update the site.

For reason of so and so, this idea was suspended; for reason of such and such, this idea was soon abandoned. 

### III. On second thought
